**[GVmaker](http://www.ggv.com.cn/gvmaker/main.php?content=about_lava)** is a programming language on a PDA product series called '文曲星'. This PDA brand was very popular in China and belongs to _Beijing Golden Global View Computer Technology LTD._

**GVmaker** is c-like and is used widely in homebrew application development. It is compiled into a kind of bytecode and executed by a software interpreter.

This project is a Java implementation of GVmaker interpreter. Its aim is to make the old homebrew GVmaker application running everywhere.

Currently we have a workable J2SE & J2ME version due to EastSun's fantastic job.

Android version is under construction based on the J2SE version. Search '**GVmakerAD**' in android market to install it.

Sample GVmaker application could be downloaded [here](http://jgvm.googlecode.com/files/GVmaker_app.zip).
