Do not install this software if you have no idea about Lava or GVmaker application :)

1. Create a folder named 'gvm' in the root of your SD card.
    Create a folder named 'LavaData' in previous folder.
	Now the folder structure should be like:
	
	<sdcard>
	|----gvm
	|----|----LavaData
	
2. Copy the Lava application (*.lav) into 'gvm'.
    Copy the data file (except *.lav) into 'LavaData'.
	
3. Launch GVmakerAD and press 'MENU' button.
    Press 'Open' to load a Lava application.
    Press 'Pause' to pause Lava application.
    Press 'Exit' to exit GVmakerAD.
	It's easy, isn't it?
	
4. Key mapping is a little strange
    'F1/F2' <=> left 'Shift/Alt'
	'F3/F4' <=> 'Search/Email'
	'ESC' <=> 'DEL'
	'Right/Down' <=> right 'Shift/Alt'
	'Left/Up' <=> './,'
	'Page Up/Down' <=> 'Volume Up/Down'
	NumPad is the same as GVmaker keyboard.

5. Unmapped GVmaker keys:
    HELP, SHIFT, CAPS, PERIOD(.)

6. NOTICE:
    * Close Chinese IME before you use keyboard.
    * Some Lava application may block GVmakerAD.
